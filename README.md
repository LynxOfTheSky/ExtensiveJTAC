# ExtensiveJTAC
This project's target is to have more functional, and yet easy to install and use JTAC.

At the moment, it's just a translated version of JTACAutoLase PLUS 1.2.4 Beta by Eagle86, which is base on infamous JTACAutoLase script (part of CTLD now).

Main feature of this version, compared to JTACAutoLase is that players control, which target type do they want to be lased. The radio menu for that is automatically created once player enters specified radius around JTAC.
The standart AutoLasing is also present.

Plans of improving:
- Adding option to switch auto-lasing from f-10 menu
- Adding full in-game control over laser code for particular JTAC
- Allowing players to change JTAC's positions
